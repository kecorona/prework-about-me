      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>My name is Kristin Corona and I am an aspiring back-end developer.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in a suburb of Philadelphia. I grew up in a small town (Blue Bell, PA) and then relocated to Glen Mills, right outside of West Chester, in order to be closer to Delaware, where my brother trained as a figure skater.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I most enjoy yoga, healthy living, and travel. Along with computer science, I studied alternative medicine and mindfulness. Homeopathy and healthy living are important factions of my lifestyle. I have learned that regimintation keeps me focused, however, I enjoy taking mini-vacations when I can to relax.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would to be a Back-end Developer. I am open to new opportunities. But, my first real passion for programming emerged after learning PHP and the LAMP stack, and that is where I felt like I excelled. So anything related to server side programming peaks my interest.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in the South End of Boston, but frequently stay at a cottage in Sanibel, Florida. I am what some call a 'Snow Bird'. Staying in the sun during the winter months is one of my favorite retreats. I have moved at least 10 times since moving to Boston, where I started my college career at Northeastern. But I have finally found an apartment in the South End that has accommodated my every need. I have two Chihuahuas, and after being cooped up in tiny apartments between Boston and Cambridge, it is nice to finally have a home where I have a private outdoor area where they can live more comfortably.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have been passionate about everything technology-related for as long as I can remember. I consider myself a tech whisperer, from tinkering, to fixing, to actual programming... it has always come naturally to me, and my passion has yet to cease. I like creating new things, and while design is not my forte, I like the mechanics of how everything comes to life.</p>
